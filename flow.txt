Idea:

The idea is every game runs in states (turn by turn basis). So if we treat each game (denoted as game_type) to
act in states we can easily define a game. For example player one's turn is a state. In this state he has multiple
options available but player 2 cannot go until player 1 is finished. Every turn (denoted by a tick) will be controlled
by a game enviroment (denoted game). This holds all of the settings for the game (at this point single/multi player).
Game is the main flow class, it determines the game_type and controls the changing of states in the game_type. This
class does not need to be very robust. Due to this being a MVC program it needs to be somewhat disconnected from itself.
In that sense the game class would have a series of methods called: set_single_player, set_multi_player and start_game_type.
So the view aspect of the app can ONLY set the amount of players and start the game.
